# Sales-Analysis-in-ActiQ-using-PostgreSQL-and-Tableau
This project contains preliminary analysis of data for a company (Actiq).
The SQL file contains 5 tables (Customers, Date, Markets, Products and Transactions). This data is then uploaded to Tableau for further working.
There ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) is performed, where a few foreign branches were not taken for consideration, chaning USD to INR etc.
Using this a series of tables and charts were formed which were then grouped together in the dashboard.
PLEASE NOTE: 1. The SQL file is in PostgreSQL and won't work for MySQL 2. Github doesn't support interactive dashboards yet. To run the same, one needs to download the Tableau worksheet and then open it in the software.
